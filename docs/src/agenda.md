Agenda for 2020-03-10: Tuesday 10th of March, 2020.
===================================================

## Items to address.
* Team Name.
* Creation and submission of Proposal
* Establishment of Lifecycle.
* Marking Guide
* Mark Goal/Ambition.	
* Conceptual Model, thoughts.
* User Analysis.
* UX and Usability Goals.
* Establish Meeting Schedule (Weekly? More often?)
* HTA (Hierarchical Task Analysis)
* Other Analysis Techniques
   * Use Case?
   * Scenarios?
   * ADD MORE
* Decide Other Team Roles.
* Discussion of Repository, suitability and alternatives.

## Notes
* Antoni Said in the workshop (I Think?!) that it's ok for screenshots in the proposal to take it over 2 pages. 
* The Github repository is *OK*, but it isn't great for those documents that need to be changed regularly (like the agenda). While we could go for an alternative that is better for this (only for the documents), I really like having everything in one place. To avoid clogging up the main thread, we could use branches (like a branch per meeting which gets merged).

## Notes
* I (Shae) Am familiar with Latex, and have used it with previous project reports. I'd very much like to do the final composition in that if possible, and am happy to get everyone's work, compose it, format it, and compile it.
